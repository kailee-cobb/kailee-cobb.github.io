	<h2><I>Becoming a Resident of Maine</I></h2>
	
	<P>Since coming to school, I have started a life of my own in Maine. I got my own
	apartment sophomore year and have lived on my own ever since. I brought my family cat,
	Arcadia, with me so she could become my study buddy. Morty has recently joined the 
	family, and I have found that he does not like studying very much. I spend most of my
	evenings playing with the cats after being gone most of the day at either school or
	work. I am currently a shift leader/bookkeeper at the Broadway Hannaford, where I began
	working in May of 2016. In the short time I have been there I have received three
	promotions, awarded service star of the month, and appeared in the company
	magazine for outstanding service. I plan on using the experience I gain with the company
	to springboard into a career in business management. </P>
