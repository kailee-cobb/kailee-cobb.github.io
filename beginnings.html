	<h1>My Beginnings</h1>
	<h2><I>Life in the Adirondacks</I><h2>
	
	<P>I was born in a small town in upstate New York and grew up in the state's most
	beautiful nature parks: The Adirondacks. The specific town that I grew up in, Keeseville,
	has no more than 1500 citizens, and is basically known for its own natural attractions,
	namely the Ausable Chasm. I worked at this attraction all throughout highschool, which 
	really helped me improve my people skills and opened my eyes to diversity. Both of these
	things became important factors that helped me prepare for college. I am the only one
	of my family to ever go to college, so my decision to go to Umaine was a big one.</P>
