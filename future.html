	<h1>Future Career Goals</h1>
	
<P>After I graduate I plan on using my acquired managerial skills to become a manager
or a department head at a scientific firm. This way I can keep my passion of physics
involved with my career. I hope that one day I will become a top-level manager after many
years of hard work. Who knows, I might even become a CEO one day!

<P> I would love to work for one of the most innovative companies in the world. <A HREF=
"https://www.spacex.com">SpaceX</A> and its parent company, <A HREF="https://www.tesla.com
">Tesla</A>, are both unique and pursue advancements in green technology and
life on other planets. The projects they are working on are huge, and I really want to be 
a part of that.</P>
