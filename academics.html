<P>I started out my academic career as a <A HREF="https://physics.umaine.edu/"> 
<u>physics</u></A> major in 2014. I enjoyed learning the course material, but I just could
not see myself spending my days shut up in a lab or teaching. At the same time I recognized
that I was doing well at my job and I decided to put my developing skills to good use. This
past year I officially changed my major to <A HREF="https://umaine.edu/business/"><u>business
management</u></A> with minors in physics and astronomy. I am expecting to graduate from 
<A HREF="https://umaine.edu/"><u>Umaine</u></A> in May 2019.</P>
